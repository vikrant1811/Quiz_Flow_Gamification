# quiz_flow_gamification

This Flutter-based Quiz App incorporates engaging gamification elements to enhance the user experience and motivation while taking quizzes. The key features include:

1.Dynamic Scoring System:
Earn points for correct answers (+4 points).
Lose points for incorrect answers (-1 point), encouraging accuracy.

2.Lives System:
Users start with 5 lives.
Each incorrect answer deducts one life.
The quiz ends automatically if all lives are lost, reinforcing the stakes and urgency in decision-making.

3.Progress Tracking:
Displays real-time stats, including:
Lives remaining.
Mistakes made.
Total score achieved.
These stats are presented in an interactive dashboard using Stat Cards.

4.Shuffled Questions:
Questions can be shuffled to add variety and unpredictability to the quiz experience.

5.Answer Feedback:
Option to reveal the correct answers after submission, allowing users to learn from their mistakes.

6.Quiz Completion Dialog:
A celebratory pop-up at the end of the quiz shows:
Final score.
Total correct and incorrect answers.
This reinforces a sense of achievement for users.

7.User Interface:
Clean and visually appealing design with gradients, responsive layouts, and animations.
Gamified elements are highlighted using vibrant color codes (e.g., red for lives, green for score).

8.Automatic Quiz Submission:
If the user runs out of lives, the app automatically submits the quiz and displays the results.
